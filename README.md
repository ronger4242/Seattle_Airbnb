## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
## Project Motivation
For this project, I am interested in using Seattle Airbnb data from 2016 to better understand:
*	How saturated is the Airbnb market in the major neighborhoods in Seattle?
* How do visitors rate location for Airbnb properties in the major neighborhoods in Seattle?
* What is the expected average monthly revenue in the major neighborhoods in Seattle?
* What types of properties are most profitable?
## File Descriptions
There is one Jupyter notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Credits must be given to Airbnb and Udacity for the data. The licensing for the data and other descriptive information can be found at the Kaggle link available here.  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like.
